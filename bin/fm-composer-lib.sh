# bin/fm-composer-lib.sh - the ONE fleet-wide owner of composer-content
# classification, shared by every session-provider adapter: the tmux path
# through bin/fm-tmux-lib.sh, and bin/backends/{herdr,orca,cmux}.sh directly.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS (task fm-composer-shellglyph-safety): the four adapters each
# carried their own copy of the "is this composer row empty / pending / not an
# agent composer" decision, and the copies drifted. The dangerous drift: a BARE
# shell prompt glyph (`>`, `$`, `%`, `#`) - what a pane shows once its agent has
# exited to a plain login shell - was treated as an empty, ready-to-inject
# AGENT composer. The away-mode escalation injector (bin/fm-supervise-daemon.sh)
# reads composer-emptiness to decide whether a pane is a safe injection target,
# so a dead-shell pane misread as "empty" meant an escalation could be typed
# into (and, worst case, executed by) that shell. Consolidating the one decision
# here means the safety rule cannot silently drift across adapters again.
#
# THE SAFETY RULE this owner enforces: a bare shell prompt glyph is a genuine
# empty agent composer ONLY when it appears INSIDE a real agent-composer
# container - a bordered composer box, where the harness draws its own prompt
# glyph (e.g. claude's older `| > ... |`). On a bare, unstructured row it is a
# dead-shell prompt and is NEVER "empty"; it classifies as `unknown` (not a safe
# injection target). The AGENT prompt glyphs `❯` (claude), `›` (codex), and
# `⟩` (U+27E9, muse) are a genuine empty agent composer either way, bordered or
# bare. Every agent glyph must be listed in ALL THREE places below - the
# ghost-stripped-to-empty fallback, the bare-row case, and the leading-glyph
# strip - because a glyph present in only some of them classifies inconsistently
# depending on how its harness happens to colour the row.
#
# GHOST/PLACEHOLDER TEXT is the other half of this owner (task
# afk-herdr-false-pending): a harness fills an otherwise-empty composer with
# de-emphasized ghost text - claude's rotating prompt suggestion, codex's idle
# suggestion, grok's placeholder - which a plain capture cannot tell apart from
# text a human typed, so the away-mode injector reads the idle pane as "pending
# input" and defers every escalation (the overnight wedge that motivated this
# consolidation). fm_composer_strip_ghost is the ONE ANSI-aware extractor of
# "real typed content": it drops every de-emphasized run - dim/faint (SGR 2, how
# claude and codex render ghost text) AND a dark/muted TRUECOLOR foreground (how
# grok renders placeholder/hint text) - and keeps only normal-intensity,
# normally-coloured text. Consolidating it here means the two ANSI-capable
# adapters (tmux via bin/fm-tmux-lib.sh, herdr via bin/backends/herdr.sh) cannot
# drift into per-harness one-off strips again; the previous herdr-only faint
# byte-pattern check missed claude's own dim ghost (its prompt glyph is not
# bold-wrapped) and no adapter covered grok's truecolor placeholder at all.
#
# Each adapter still owns its own CAPTURE and structural row-finding, because
# those use genuinely different primitives (tmux's visible-pane box scan,
# herdr's ANSI tail scan, orca/cmux's plain read-screen). Once an adapter has a
# candidate composer row it hands the RAW styled row to
# fm_composer_strip_ghost for the real-typed-content extraction, strips the box
# borders, trims, and hands the result plus a <bordered> flag to
# fm_composer_classify_content for the shared
# empty|pending|unknown verdict. orca/cmux read a plain (unstyled) screen so
# they have no ghost styling to strip and rely on the idle-placeholder match
# below. Re-sourcing is a cheap idempotent redefinition, so this file needs no
# include guard (matching bin/fm-tmux-lib.sh).

# fm_composer_strip_ansi: drop every CSI escape sequence, leaving plain text.
# Used for STRUCTURAL row/shape detection, where ghost text must be KEPT so the
# composer box border or bare prompt glyph is still visible; content extraction
# uses fm_composer_strip_ghost instead. Reads the styled text on stdin and prints
# plain text (stdin-only, matching fm_composer_strip_ghost). The character class
# includes ':' so an ITU colon-form SGR (38:2::r:g:b) is stripped whole, not left
# with a dangling tail.

# fm_composer_strip_ghost: the ONE fleet-wide ANSI-aware extractor of "real typed
# content" from a captured, styled composer row. Reads the styled line on stdin
# (from `tmux capture-pane -e` or `herdr pane read --format ansi`) and prints the
# plain, non-ghost text on stdout, dropping:
#   - dim/faint runs (SGR 2): how claude and codex render ghost/suggestion text.
#     A reset (SGR 0) or normal-intensity (SGR 22) ends a dim run.
#   - dark/muted TRUECOLOR foreground runs (SGR 38;2;r;g;b or the colon form
#     38:2::r:g:b) whose perceived luminance (0.299R + 0.587G + 0.114B) is below
#     FM_COMPOSER_GHOST_LUMA_MAX (default 128): how grok renders its placeholder
#     and hint text. A reset (SGR 0), a default-foreground (SGR 39), any base
#     foreground colour (30-37 / 90-97), or a lighter 38;2 foreground ends the
#     dark-foreground run. This assumes a DARK terminal theme, the firstmate
#     fleet reality, where real typed input is bright and only de-emphasised UI
#     is dark; the SGR-2 signal above stays theme-independent. A 256-colour
#     foreground (38;5;n) is NOT luminance-tested - it is palette-dependent and
#     no fleet harness uses it for ghost text, so it is kept (real text wins:
#     under-stripping merely defers, which the max-defer alarm surfaces, while
#     over-stripping would inject over real input).
# Raising FM_COMPOSER_GHOST_LUMA_MAX is not free: muse draws its `⟩` prompt glyph
# in truecolor 38;2;90;160;255, luminance ~149.9 (verified, muse 0.1.0-R708.1),
# the tightest margin over the 128 default in the fleet. Above ~150 that glyph is
# stripped as ghost text, which is why the bare-glyph fallback below must also
# recognise every agent glyph from the UNSTRIPPED plain row.
# The dim/faint and dark-foreground states are tracked together as "de-emphasis";
# codes are processed left to right within a sequence, so "ESC[0;2m" reads as dim.
# LC_ALL=C makes awk walk bytes, so multibyte glyphs (e.g. ❯) and de-emphasised
# runs alike pass through or drop intact without locale-dependent classes.

# NON-ASCII PADDING (task fm-afk-wedge-unreachable). A harness may pad its own
# composer row with a space character that bash's `[:space:]` does not match in a
# UTF-8 locale: claude 2.1.226 draws its EMPTY composer as `❯` U+00A0 (bytes
# e2 9d af c2 a0), so an idle composer holding nothing at all classified as
# `pending`. The away-mode daemon then deferred every escalation into a pane the
# captain could see was empty - 4714 deferrals on 2026-08-09 and 345 more the
# next day - and the entry pre-flight in bin/fm-afk-launch.sh refuses a delivery
# path that is in fact healthy.
#
# The trim below is deliberately narrow. It removes only characters in Unicode's
# SPACE SEPARATOR (Zs) category, from the two ENDS of the content, and nothing
# else. That keeps it to characters that carry no input and that a captain has no
# way to type as content, so it corrects a false positive without ever making
# genuine unsubmitted text injectable:
#   - interior characters are never touched, so `a<U+00A0>b` stays pending;
#   - zero-width and format characters are NOT in this set and are never
#     trimmed. That is load-bearing for U+200B and for U+2063, the operational
#     prefix marker: a composer holding an unsent injection still reads pending.
# A character outside Zs stays real text, which is the safe direction: an
# unrecognised pad merely defers, and the max-defer alarm surfaces that, while
# over-trimming would type over a captain's line.
